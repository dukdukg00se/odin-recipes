        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 thick cut rib eye steaks</li>
          <li>1 cup low sodium soy sauce (do <strong>NOT</strong> use regular! it will ruin your steaks!)/li>
          <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
          <li>1⁄2 cup brown sugar</li>
          <li>6 ounces pineapple juice</li>
          <li>1/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons fresh minced ginger</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Add soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, pineapple juice and apple cider vinegar to a small pot. Bring to a boil then simmer over low heat for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and pour the marinade into a large shallow dish (to marinate steaks later). Set aside until it’s cooled, or to speed up the process, cover and place it in the fridge until it’s cool.</li>
          <li>Add steaks into the dish with marinade. Cover and place in fridge for 1 hour. Flip sides and cover for another 1 hour in the fridge. I prefer to marinate over night.</li>
          <li>20 minutes before starting the grill, take dish with steaks out (still covered) to cool to room temperature. Heat grill.</li>
          <li>Heat grill to high and grill steaks for 5 minutes. Flip and continue to grill for 4 minutes (for medium-rare to medium). Use an internal thermometer (135F for medium-rare and 140F for medium). Transfer steaks to a platter and tent with foil to let rest for 5 minutes. Grill some pineapple slices along with the steaks for garnish.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Can add more pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar for heightened sweetness. Also good on chicken and other beef. Best to marinate for at least 24 hours.</p>
