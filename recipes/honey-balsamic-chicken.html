            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
              <li>Kosher salt</li>
              <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
              <li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
              <li>2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar</li>
              <li>1/3 c. honey</li>
              <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
              <li>Canola oil for greasing</li>
              <li>Chopped chives for garnish</li>
              <li>Chopped parsley for garnish</li>
              <li>Lemon wedges for garnish</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Place the chicken thighs on a large plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper on all sides. Work the seasoning into the chicken. Let sit, in the refrigerator, for at least an hour.</li>
              <li>Meanwhile, make the glaze: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter. Add the vinegar, honey, and garlic and stir until the honey has dissolved. Season with salt and pepper. Set near the grill.</li>
              <li>Preheat grill to medium high and clean and grease the grates with canola oil. Add chicken skin side-down and grill, flipping often and basting with sauce, until cooked through, 10 minutes per side.</li>
              <li>Serve with lemon wedges and garnish with chives and parsley.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>      

          <div>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>When it's time to cook, preheat your grill or grill pan for a good 10 to 15 minutes, until the grates are extremely hot. Then cook for about 10 minutes per side. Time will vary based on the size of the thighs. Your golden number when it comes to poultry: an internal temperature of 165°F.</p>
            <p>Pro tip! Because of the honey and the sugar content in the balsamic vinegar, the glaze can burn if left to caramelize on the grill for too long. To avoid this, we recommend moving your chicken around occasionally so that different parts of the thighs are hitting the grates.</p>
